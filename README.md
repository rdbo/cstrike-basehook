# Counter-Strike BaseHook by rdbo
This project is a basehook for the game Counter-Strike specifically. For a more global version, use <a href="https://github.com/rdbo/GL-BaseHook">rdbo/GL-BaseHook</a>. It hooks the function wglSwapBuffers and the Window Proc, and implements Dear ImGUI using <a href="https://github.com/rdbo/libmem">my memory lib</a>.  
  
# How to use
First of all, you have to make sure you have <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a> installed.  
Then, you just need to open the solution on VS and do the changes you want.  
I also recommend turning on the option *Show All Files* on Visual Studio for a better view of the project.  
Have fun!
